NLP-project Due 2021 Dec 1st

My goal is to train servral models using dialogues from movie script, and. let them have a back and forth conversation. 

After that i will try to compare this computer generated text to human created crossover work, to do some critical thinking, as a way to pay tribute to the fandom culture 

i can't load everything that's in my checkpoint folder because some of them is too big.so i'll just put the file names in here:
1. model-60.data-00000-of-00001
